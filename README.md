## Bowser Mask & Costume

{costume description]

### The Mask

The mask was first modeled around my face structure by taking a lidar 3D topology scan of my face with the use of an iPad Pro and a lidar app. The resulting 3D model from the scan was uploaded to ZBrush, along with a 3D model of Bowser's face which was then molded around my face and shaped into a mask to make a perfect and comfortable fit. slits in the side of the model were added to later attach straps to hold the mask to my face. This was all done with the help of my friend Henry Qiu ([@derailed3D on Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/derailed3d/)). The final 3D model was then printed out of PLA then painted to match Bowser's cartoon appearance. A piece of cloth was attached to the backside of the mask over the mouth hole to give the inside of the mouth a realistic depth effect while also leaving a breathable openning around my mouth to allow good airflow. Strips of cloth were attached to the side mounting holes to allow me to tie the mask to my face with easy temporary removal.

After printing, painting, and gluing on cloth mouthpiece to the inside:
